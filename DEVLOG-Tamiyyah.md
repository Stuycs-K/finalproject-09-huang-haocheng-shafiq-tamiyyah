### 2025-15-05 - Topic Brainstorming and Piazza Proposal Submission
Spent the period plus a few brief talks and text messages previously brainstorming project ideas with Haocheng. We researched and discussed multiple cybersecurity topics, then submitted our required Piazza post with five ideas:
* social engineering attack simulator (eg. phishing email, fake login page)
* Automated phasing website detection using AI
* Diffie-hellman key exchange
* spam email classification (machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam w/ naive bayes or logical regression)
* ai-based password cracking

### 2025-16-05 - Topic Refinement
Researched code obfuscation and audio steganography during the period.

### 2025-19-05 - Topic Refinement
Researched code obfuscation and audio steganography some more, decided on code obfuscation.

### 2025-20-05 - GitHub Repo Update
Caught up on GitHub setup and made initial commits. Behind on daily updates, so added missing logs and pushed current progress to the repo. Spent half a period doing this, the rest doing more research and discussing with Haocheng. Mapped out on paper different methods we could implement.

### 2025-27-05 - Research and Planning Out Coding Component
Added some more to the slides and started to plan out the different obfuscation methods we could code. Discussed with Mr. K. Going to likely add one methods at a time -- name obfuscation, dummy/junk code, string encryption, compressing code -- and see how much we get through.

### 2025-28-05 - Started coding
Coded replace variable names and replace function names.

### 2025-29-05 - Pair programmed code
Added vigenere cipher function for name change obfuscation.
