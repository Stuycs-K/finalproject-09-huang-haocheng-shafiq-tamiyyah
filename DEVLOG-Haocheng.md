### 2025-15-05 - Topic Brainstorming, Piazza Proposal Submission, and Revision
Brainstormed project ideas with Tamiyyah. Researched, discussed, and  submitted our required Piazza post:
* social engineering attack simulator (eg. phishing email, fake login page)
* Automated phasing website detection using AI
* Diffie-hellman key exchange
* spam email classification (machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam w/ naive bayes or logical regression)
* ai-based password cracking

Replied to Mr. K's proposal feedback after discussing with Tamiyyah.

### 2025-16-05 - Topic Refinement
Researched code obfuscation and audio steganography during the period.

### 2025-19-05 - Topic Refinement
Researched code obfuscation and audio steganography some more, decided on code obfuscation.

### 2025-20-05 - Started Presentation Slides
Began drafting the presentation slides. Outlined the main sections and added initial content. Spent a period doing this.

### 2025-21-05 - Presentation Slides
Continued working on the presentation slides and researching code obfuscation. Spent a period doing this.

### 2025-21-05 - Continued Research
Continued researching code obfuscation. Looked at Wikipedia page and some scholarly articles about the topic (eg. *A Box, Darkly:
Obfuscation, Weird Languages, and Code Aesthetics* by Michael Mateas and Nick Montfort, *Mechanisms for Source Code Obfuscation in C:
Novel Techniques and Implementation* by Pallavi Ahire, Jibi Abraham).

### 2025-25-05 - Presentation Slides
Almost finalized presentation slides.

### 2025-28-05 - edited code
Coded process for outputting dictionary to file. Discussed further plans for coding component (seeded obfuscation, burying good code in a long decision tree).

### 2025-29-05 - Pair programmed code
Added vigenere cipher function for name change obfuscation.

### 2025-30-05 - Pair programmed code
Worked on implementing functions that remove newlines and spaces from the code file

### 2025-01-06 - Added presentation.md
Converted Google Docs format to .md format, added more information, and added to repo

### 2025-02-06 - pair programming
Added modes for running program, wrote a more efficient version of FindSpaces, debugged other modes, implemented function to remove all empty lines, implemented function to add dead code.
